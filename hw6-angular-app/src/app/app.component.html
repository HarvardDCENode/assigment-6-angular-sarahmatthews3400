<h1> Tea Journal</h1>
Welcome to the Angular version of my tea journal application!<br/>
It closely mimics the Photos application for simplicity's sake, for now. <br/>
I'll augment it when I integrate it with the REST backend for the final. <br/>
Number of Teas: {{ numTeas }}
<p>Total Votes Received: {{ totalVotes }}, Most Recent Vote Recipient: {{ mostRecentVotedOn }}</p>
<app-tea
  *ngFor='let teaObject of teaList'
  [tea]="teaObject"
  (upvotedEvent)="handleUpvoted($event)">
</app-tea>
