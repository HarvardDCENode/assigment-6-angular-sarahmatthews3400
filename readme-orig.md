ope# Assignment #6 - Angular

This Angular application is closely based on the Photos example code, so it has limited functionality--it just lists the example tea data and lets you upvote the tea cards. I think that's sufficient for this assignment, but I'll add the other functionality back in for the final. 

(I 100% recommend trying any and all teas listed if you like tea.)
